🧮 Simple Calculator with History (Python CLI Project)
A command-line Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and maintains a history of calculations. 
Users can view, clear, or continue from their previous calculations easily via built-in commands.

🚀 Features
Perform basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

View calculation history using the history command.

Clear history using the clear command.

Prevents division by zero and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Automatically stores results in a history.txt file.

🛠️ How It Works
Run the script.

Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., 8 + 4).

Use commands:

history: Displays previous calculations.

clear: Deletes all stored history.

exit: Terminates the program.

📂 Files
calculator_with_history.py — Main Python script containing the calculator logic.

history.txt — Text file where all successful calculations are stored.

🧑‍💻 Sample Run

Enter calculation(+ - * /) or command (history,clear,exit) = 5 + 5
Result: 10

Enter calculation(+ - * /) or command (history,clear,exit) = history
5 + 5=10
8 * 8 =64

Enter calculation(+ - * /) or command (history,clear,exit) = clear
History cleared.

Enter calculation(+ - * /) or command (history,clear,exit) = exit
Goodbye
📝 Requirements
Python 3.x

💡 Future Improvements
GUI integration using Tkinter or PyQt.

Support for parentheses and complex expressions.

Export history as a CSV or JSON file.
